            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ery lately, and al moſt at the ſame time, J receiued two Pamphlets both written againſt my <hi>Vindication of the English Catholicks;</hi> one by you, the other without any name: I intend in this ſecond edition to anſwer what is material in both, althô this Preface is directed particularly to you, 1. Becauſe you name your ſelfe. 2. The other ſpeakes more to my <hi>Vindication,</hi> you more to <hi>me,</hi> &amp; for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may in ciuility expect a returne. 3. Becauſe you pretend to more intimacy with me, then ordinary, to be my boſome freind, &amp; to know the <hi>ſecrets of my hart,</hi> &amp; my <hi>Conſeſsions</hi> too: for pag. 13. you tell the world; <hi>I abhorr the King in my hart;</hi> and a little after <hi>you ſay: I neuer call the King ſacred, but I receiue Abſolution.</hi> This expreſſes a greater familiarity, then <hi>Oates</hi> pretended with the Ieſuits: if you go on, you may ſtand faire for a witneſſes wages, &amp; vie with the pretended Doctor himſelf, in the Art of Diſcovering Plots.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this you declare that you know not who am, &amp; ſeeme very much concerned to find it out. Pag. 2. <hi>In the firſt place, it behoues vs ſtrictly to examin who this</hi> Titan <hi>of a Vindicator is,</hi> &amp; pag. 44. <hi>you muſt come, &amp; tell vs who you are.</hi> In fine all, that you can diſcerne of me, is contained in theſe words; pag. 2. <hi>There is no queſtion to be made, but that I am a</hi> Roman Catholick. So all your ſtrict enquiry affords you no further lyght, then which ſerues to diſcerne my Religion. But as for my Perſon you know not whither I am little, or greate, blacke, or white, a German, Indian, Spaniard, or Engliſh. And yet you boldly aſſure you know my hart, when you do not know my face!</p>
            <p>You blame me for vſing vnciuil language: I wiſh you were leſſe obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to that blame. You ſay pag. 5. <hi>We Profeſse a profligate Religion, a vicious &amp; mishapen mixture of Ceremony, &amp; ſuperſtition, that will not paſſe the muſter of common Reaſon.</hi> And p. 48. <hi>A religion of no credit, founded vpon forgery, a ſort of Deuotion, that no man of Reaſon can admit into his Beleif, or Conſcience: in the practice diametrically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the precepts of Chriſt, Our Saints to be ſported with, as the train of Heathen Deïtyes.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the ornaments of your ciuil language, when you blame mine, as vnciuil. Did I not perceiue, that you are well ſtored, with ſuch coine, I ſhould think you would be ſoone out of purſe, you ſpend ſo freely. But you haue an Indian mine of ſuch mettal, &amp; a mint in your Braine.</p>
            <p>I find no cauſe, giuen by me for all this riboldry, but 1. that p. 2. I ſayd out of Pamphlet <hi>that</hi> Oates's <hi>Phiſognomy was an Index to all villany, &amp; that a lettred man may reade Rogue in his face.</hi> And 2. that I call his vntru Depoſitions, <hi>Lyes.</hi> To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt: I cite my Authour, out of whome I cite thoſe words. I am certain they are there: and am not further concerned, whither tru, or falſe.</p>
            <p>To the 2. ſeing the Depoſitions are <hi>falſe things ſignifyed in word, with an intent to deceiue: which</hi> (as you ſay p. 18.) <hi>is the definition of a Lye,</hi> I thought I myght put the <hi>Definitum,</hi> for the Definition, his Depoſitions being of that nature. And though the word ought not to be vſed in ciuil company, to a man of honour, or honeſty, yet in a ſpeech directed to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who ſhews ſo little of ether, I thought it myht paſſe, no other of the like ſignification occurring. Yet ſeing they are not only <hi>knowne vntruths ſpoken with intention to deceiue;</hi> but alſo confirmed by Oath, I ſhall hereafter terme them <hi>Periuryes.</hi> Jt may be this word will leſſe offend your tender ciuilized eares, If not, I know not how to helpe it: for we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152770:3"/>muſt ether not ſpeake of things, or call them by their names, a boat, a boat, a ſpade, aſpade, &amp; a Periury by its proper name.</p>
            <p>You tell me p. 27. <hi>You expected I should haue shewne my wit &amp; Rhetorick, the creame of my Eloquence, haue ſtrewd flowere, Metaphors, &amp; ſorites, &amp; haue gored the Doctor with forked Dilemma's.</hi> Elſwhere you reproach me, that I ſhew no reading, cite no Authours, &amp;c. And vpon this you ground all thoſe Characters, which you giue of me, <hi>Sot, foole, Dunce, Blockhead,</hi> &amp;c. And had I done ſo, you would haue blamed that, &amp; haue ſayd, that Truth ſtands not of neede of theſe meretri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dreſſes, to make her ſeeme louely: &amp; that all was to delude the Reader. Thus whateuer we doe, whither we Pipe, or mourne, we muſt be blamed. Learned Sir, when I began that worke, I looked on it not as a combat of wit; but of Truth: I deſigned not to ſhew my learning; but our Innocency: Nor to compoſe an Oration; but an <hi>Affidauit</hi> out of the Atteſtations of Perſons of knowne integrity, to confute the Periuryes of one infamous man. J ſay <hi>infamous,</hi> for ſo he is, in the eye not only of Catholicks who know his Depoſitions to be falſe: but likewiſe of the far greater part of Proteſtants themſelues, ſome where of though deſeruing nothing leſſe haue felt the weyght of his tongue, &amp; the malice of that Faction, whoſe jnſtrument he is: &amp; others hitherto vntoucht, may juſtly feare the like.</p>
            <p>What a piece of Pedantry would it be, not to ſpeake of water without citing <hi>Pindar's</hi> commendation of it, telling what Philoſophers held it to be the firſt principle of all things? that <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken out of it in ſcriptures, &amp; <hi>Venus</hi> in the Fables: what Poets ſay of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> &amp; how Mathologiſts vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them? &amp;c. who could with patience heare a man vpon the naming of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or ſhip, run vp to the <hi>Argonautes,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Noak's</hi> Arke: ſhould then endeauour to ſhew when ſayles, when the Rudder, &amp; when the compaſſe was firſt in vſe? How long men kept to the ſhore? when <hi>Audax Iapeti genus</hi> firſt lanched into the deepe beyond all land-markes, without any other guide, but the ſtars, &amp; ſhould lard into his diſcourſe ſhreds of Poets, &amp; Orators, Latin &amp; Greeke &amp; make vp his ſpeech as a beggers coate, of patches? This you ſeeme to require of me: &amp; would with much more reaſon haue condemned me, for it, as an impertinent Pedant, &amp; a babler without ſenſe, or reaſon, had you found any ſuch thing in my <hi>Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſpeake of matters of Fact: viz, whither <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omers</hi> all <hi>April,</hi> &amp; <hi>May</hi> 1678, as we ſay with truth; or went into <hi>England,</hi> (as he falſly depoſes) to aſſiſt at a Conſult of <hi>Ieſuits</hi> in <hi>London?</hi> What lyght, to decide this queſtion, can <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Ennius, Heſiod,</hi> or <hi>Plautus, Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>Virgil, Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Eſayas,</hi> or the <hi>Pſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lmes,</hi> the Greeke of Latin fathers, giue in this queſtion, which they neuer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152770:4"/>&amp; where of the greateſt part dyed before <hi>S.

Wherefore do our laws in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> require Categoricall anſwers in Trialls, cutting off all Rhetoricall digreſſions? was it to conceale the Truth of Fact, from the eyes of the Jury? or becauſe they Iudged them both vnneceſſary, &amp; vnvſe full &amp; therefore the way of <hi>witnesſing</hi> by word of mouth, when Perſons were preſent, &amp; <hi>Affidauits,</hi> or <hi>Atteſtations</hi> when they were abſent, was eſtabliſht?</p>

               <p>Narrat. pag. 2. §. 3. <hi>R. Ashby, R. Peters, N. Blundel, &amp; Ch. Peters ſent twelue ſchollers into Spaine, as appeared by their Patents, eyght to Valladolid, &amp; four to Madrid who were obliged by the Ieſuits to renounce their Allegiance to his Majeſty of Great Britain, in the hearing of the Deponent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerv. Here are many Periuryes. The 1. that the ſtudents were ſent by <hi>four Ieſuits.</hi> Their ſending is always by the Rector alone, and in his abſence by the <hi>Vice-Rector,</hi> &amp; none elſe medle with ſending any from one place to another.</p>
               <p>The 2. that this <hi>appeared by their Patents.</hi> Neuer any Patents amongſt Ieſuits had more then one name, whether made by a Rector, a Prouincial, or the General. None but a Superiour ſignes them: wherefore none of theſe could ſign them beſides R. <hi>Ashby</hi> he being the only Superiour.</p>
               <p>The third, that <hi>they renounced their Allegiance to his Majeſty.</hi> There is not one word of that in the Oath of thoſe Colledges. All it containes is, to demean themſelues peaceably in the Colledg, to take Orders, when thought fit by ſuperiors, &amp; to return to their Country.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that <hi>this renounciation was made in your hearing.</hi> The four ſent to <hi>Madrid</hi> could not take the oath till they were there: &amp; you neuer were there. Nether could you heare thoſe at <hi>Valladolid:</hi> who did not take it till they had paſt a whole yeare in that place to try whither they would be fit, for ſuch a Vocation. And for this reaſon it was neuer tendred to you becauſe you had not been a year there.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 3. §. 4. <hi>D. Armſtrong brought letters ſubſcribed by ſiue Ieſuits. In which was expreſſed that the Ieſuits in London intended to diſpoſe of the King within a year, &amp; of his R. H. if he did not anſwer their expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:152770:17"/>
               <p>Obſeru. you haue two Periuryes here. The 1. that thoſe letters were ſigned by then the Rector. See Atteſt. C.</p>
               <p>The 2. that there were any ſuch thing in thoſe letters ſent by D. Armeſtrong. ſee Atteſt. D. K. O. Q The Perſons named Proteſt they neuer heard of any ſuch thing till they ſaw the <hi>Narratiue.</hi> And <hi>F. Thom. Fermor,</hi> one of the fiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſubſcribers, was not then at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> nor had been there in ſeuen years before. See Atteſt. K.

               <p>Obſeru. Here is another Periury: nether <hi>F. Suiman,</hi> nor any other euer heard any ſuch news.</p>

They vſed all meanes to procure Perſons to diſpatch the King.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. It is falſe 1. that euer <hi>R. Strange</hi> writ any ſuch letter. See Atteſt G.</p>
               <p>It is falſe 2. that euer you were at <hi>Madrid.</hi> See Atteſt. A. B. L. On the 1. of <hi>Iune</hi> you arriued at <hi>Valladolid:</hi> &amp; from that till the 30. of <hi>October,</hi> when you were turned out you neuer lodged one nyght out of the Colledge of <hi>Valla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid,</hi> ſo vnleſſe you were in two places at the ſame time, you were not at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 4. §. 7. <hi>At the ſame time in</hi> Madrid <hi>the Deponent ſaw a letter from</hi> R. Strange, F. Gray, Keynes, B Langworrh, I. Fenwick, F. Ireland, &amp; F. Harcourt, <hi>which expreſt their ſorrow, the buſineſſe was not don through the faint hartedneſs of their man</hi> William.</p>
               <p>Obſeruat. here you continue in the ſame falſe ſtory of your being <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another vntruth is that many <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſhould ſign a letter with their Prouincial. Which I haue often noted to be fals.</p>
               <p>A third, that there euer was ſuch a letter. ſee Atteſt. G. &amp; R.</p>

               <p>Obſeru. Here we haue many Periurys. The firſt, that P. <hi>P. H. de Corduba was Prouincial of New-Caſtille,</hi> he neuer had any thing to doe within <hi>New-Caſtille.</hi> And which is yet more, there is not in all the ſociety any Prouince ſo called.</p>

You left <hi>Valladolid</hi> on the 30. of <hi>October,</hi> &amp; arriued at <hi>Bilbao</hi> on <hi>Nouember</hi> the 3. ſee Atteſt. M. you are very vnfortunate in timing your Depoſitions.</p>
               <p>A third, that euer <hi>there was any letter.</hi> ſee. Atteſt G.

Yet I hear that moſt or all their Letters of ſeuerall yeares were found &amp; pervſed by Authority, &amp; not one word found inſinuating any ſuch thing.

               <p>Narrat. p. 7. §. 12. <hi>F. By letters of the</hi> 18. <hi>of December it was ſpecifyed that</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas White, alias Whitebread <hi>was made Prouincial; who ordred</hi> F. Georg Coniers <hi>to preach in the Sodality Church on</hi> S. Thomas <hi>of</hi> Canterbury's <hi>day agvinſt the Oaths of Allegiance &amp; ſupremacy; &amp; exhorted the Fathers to ſtand by the new Prouincial, who would be as Zealous to promote Religion, as his Predeceſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. you giue here a whole couy of Lyes. firſt Mr. <hi>Thom. White breade</hi> was not declared Prouincial till the 14 <hi>of Ianuary</hi> 1678. ſoe could not order that ſermon for S. Thomas day in <hi>December,</hi> before he had any power to order.</p>
               <p>Againe it is impertinent to ſay the Prouincial at a diſtance ſhould order, who ſhould make a particular ſermon. That is left always to the Rectors, who being vpon the Places know the conuenience, which each one hath for ſuch a task.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it is fals, that he was ordred to preach againſt the Oaths. He himſelf &amp; thoſe who heard that ſermon, proteſt there was not one word of the Oaths in it. And this appeares in the Copy he keepes of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a fiction of your ſhallow braine, to ſay that <hi>F. Coniers</hi> ſhould be <hi>ordred to exhort all to ſtandby their new Prouincial.</hi> This was neuer practiſed. Aſſoon as the Prouincial is declared &amp; all acquainted with it, each one knows his Duty to him: &amp; comply with it without any further exhortation. And if this ſhould haue been neceſſary, F. <hi>Con.</hi> would not haue been employed in it, who (althô of excellent parts, &amp; great expectation,) yet is amongſt the youngeſt. Nether was the ſodality Church a place conuenient for ſuch a ſermon, this being a place deſigned for the Deuotion of the ſchollers, whither the Fathets rarely come. As great confident as you make your ſelf of Ieſuits, you do not know the place,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152770:19"/>where their domeſtick Exhortations are made, at <hi>S. Omers.</hi> Laſtly, thoſe letters were of the 18. of <hi>December,</hi> ſay you, from <hi>London,</hi> which according to the Newſtile is the 28. the day before <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury's.</hi> I deſire you to tell vs, what man in his ſenſes would write from <hi>London</hi> beyond ſeas, to be ſpeake a ſermon for the next day? And if any was ſo mad, how his Letter could be deliuered in time, as you ſay this was, or elſe you are Periured?</p>
               <p>Narr. pag. 7. §. 13. Thomas Whitebread <hi>&amp; twelue others whom you name, &amp; more whom you do not name by Letter dated the</hi> 26. <hi>of</hi> December <hi>ordred, that</hi> R. Aſhby <hi>should write to</hi> F. Leſhee <hi>that they had met to contriue the aduancement of the Deſign of the happy Diſpoſal of his Majeſty,</hi> &amp; of his R. H. if he anſwered not their expectation.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. Your firſt Periury is that ſo often noted, of <hi>many Ieſuits writing letters with their Prouincial.</hi> Which is neuer practiſed.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond, that <hi>Thom. White was Prouincial</hi> on the 26. of <hi>December</hi> 77. he was not declared till the 14. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your</hi> 3 <hi>that there were in any Letter ſuch contents.</hi> ſee Atteſt. G E Indeed if they had a Deſign to giue ſuch informations to <hi>P. Leshee,</hi> they would haue directed their letters ſtreyght to him: vnleſſe you pretend they could not write Latin in which Ieſuits are ſeldom defectiue. But why they ſhould ſend ſuch a letter to <hi>S. Omers,</hi> thence to be conueyghed to <hi>Paris,</hi> I know not except it were, with intention it ſhould be ſhown to you, theyr great Agent.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 8. § 15. <hi>In the ſame Letter was ſpecified that</hi> Richard Nic. Blundel <hi>was by Patent from the Prouincial made Ordinary of</hi> Newgate <hi>to viſit the condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: &amp; to Catechize ſome youth in the City of London whom he teacheth Treaſonable &amp; mutinous Doctrines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You here deliuer many Periuryes, the firſt is that there euer were any ſuch Letters, as I ſayd already.</p>
               <p>The 2. that <hi>Ieſuits should become Ordinarys.</hi> Their being ordinary is a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of euen in Catholick countrys.</p>
               <p>The 3. That <hi>this was don by Patent from the Prouincial.</hi> The Prouincial giues no office by patent.</p>
               <p>The 4. That that Father (whoſe name you know not) ſhould <hi>teach the youths Treaſonable &amp; mutinous doctrine.</hi> This is not only fals; but improbable alſo: &amp; Ieſuits myght be begged for fooles, if they deliuered ſuch doctrines to <hi>Children,</hi> or <hi>youths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Prouincial did employ one in works of charity, did order him to viſit the Priſoners, ſent to them ſom Almes, according to his ability, recommended to the ſame Perſon, to comfort the vnfortunate condemned Perſons in their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152770:19"/>deſolate condition, to exhort them to ſorrow for their ſins, which brought them to that diſgracefull end, &amp; to prepare them to end well this miſerable life if I ſay he did ſo, &amp; did it out of theſe motiues I know none beſides your ſelf ſo great an Atheiſt as to blame him for it. The Thing is ſo conformable to ryght Reaſon, &amp; ſoe cleerely recommended in the Ghoſpel (Mat. 25.36.) that he muſt renounce both, who condemnes it.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 9. §. 15. <hi>Other Letters dated on the</hi> 1. <hi>or</hi> 2. <hi>of Ianuary came to</hi> R Aſhby <hi>from</hi> Thom. White, <hi>&amp; others, ordring them to perſwade the</hi> D. de Villa-Hermoſa, that the K. <hi>of</hi> England <hi>would not asſiſt</hi> Spain <hi>in this war. That</hi> Fonſeca <hi>ſent his Letter to</hi> S. Omers <hi>from</hi> Bruges <hi>to be ſent for</hi> Spain <hi>to inform that King, that the English Marchants endeauoured to tranſport their eſtates, &amp; to aduiſe him to ſeize on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeruat. I will note here only two of your Periuryes: The firſt, that <hi>many Ieſuits ioyned to giue thoſe orders, &amp; ſigned thoſe Letters.</hi> Which was neuer done, as is often noted.</p>
               <p>A ſecond that <hi>Thom. White as Prouincial writ them.</hi> He was not Prouincial, till the 14. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> &amp; came not to <hi>London,</hi> till about the 12 ſo could haue no hand in theſe pretended Letters, dated on 1. or 2. as you ſay. But more of theſe letters, on the next §.</p>
               <p>You ſeem quite thorough your fabulous Narratiue to repreſent <hi>S. Omers,</hi> as the center of all Ieſuits Tranſactions &amp; Letters. Thoſe from or for <hi>London, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Bruſselles, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Vienna, Valladolid,</hi> &amp;c. all paſſe that way. For what reaſon I know not, vnleſſe it were, becauſe that great man, you Mr. <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> was there: for all who know <hi>S. Omers,</hi> know there is ſcarſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable town in the low country's worſe ſerued with Letters, then that, whileſt it was vnder the Obedience of the Spaniards. Which is in ſom manner amended ſince it changed its Maſter; yet ſtill it yeilds to moſt other townes of the ſame bigneſſe in certaine &amp; ſpeedy correſpondence. Nether can you pretend it ſhould be in conſideration of the Colledg, ſeing that of <hi>Liege</hi> take places of it. But you were at <hi>S. Omers</hi> &amp; as the loadſtone draws Iron, ſoe you drew all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to you.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 10. §. 16. <hi>On the</hi> 3. <hi>of</hi> Ianuary <hi>in the after noon when the Letters aboue mentioned came from</hi> England E. Neuil, <hi>&amp;</hi> Th. For nor <hi>in the Ieſuits library at</hi> S. Omers, <hi>ſayd:</hi> they would not let. . . . . the <hi>King go to his Graue in Peace, &amp; that the Duke's Paſport was ready when be should appear to ſail them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru Seing you heard theſe words when the Letters were receiued, you neuer heard them, for there were no ſuch Letters. ſee Atteſt. E. K. Q.</p>
               <p>Your vntruths in this &amp; the precedent article doe interfere. Theſe Letters were written at <hi>London,</hi> on the 1. or 2. let it be on the 1. it muſt be on the 2.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152770:20"/>early before they left <hi>London,</hi> &amp; you ſay here they were receiued on the 3. at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> in the morning for on the afternoon you heard that diſcourſe after their receipt. Now I appeal to the <hi>Poſt-Officers,</hi> whether Letters goe at that rate, as to be in little more then 24. houres carryed from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>S. Omers.</hi> Vnleſſe you will pretend that the Jeſuits vſed ſome winged Mercury or Eaſtern Pigeons, for their Meſſengers. And if we conſider that Letters from <hi>London</hi> are dated always according to the old ſtile, &amp; days counted at <hi>S. Omers</hi> according to the new, thoſe Letters dated on the 1. or 2. &amp; receiued on the third muſt haue been receiued 8. or 9. days before they were written. What think you, ſir, Are not theſe pretry fables to trouble the world with?</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 10. §. 17. <hi>Letters were ſent by</hi> Richard Aſhby <hi>&amp; ſeuen other Ieſuits of</hi> S. Omers, <hi>&amp; by</hi> F. Williams, <hi>&amp; two others of</hi> Watten <hi>to the Emperour's Confeſſor to acquaint the Emperour that the</hi> K. <hi>of</hi> England <hi>had treatherouſly plotted the ruin of the Confederates, &amp; the</hi> German <hi>Empire eſpecially, that he had ſticred vp the</hi> Hungarian <hi>Rebels, &amp; found them mony to go on with their Rebellion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. There neuer was any ſuch Letters or Letter as you mention. Not one of all thoſe named by you euer receiued, or ſent any Letter from or to the Emperour's Confeſſor. ſee Atteſt. E. K. O. Q And we need no further diſproof of this fable then to ſee ſo many Ieſuits writing the ſame Letters: which is a tranſcendental fiction.</p>
               <p>Narrat. pag. 11. §. 18. <hi>Letters from</hi> Talbot Arch Bp. <hi>of</hi> Dublin <hi>expreſt the vigilancy of Ieſuits in</hi> Ireland <hi>to prepare People to riſe. That in caſe of war with</hi> France <hi>a place should be open to receiue the French army, &amp; that</hi> E. N. &amp; W. B. <hi>carryed this intelligence to</hi> F. Leſhee.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. All this is falſe. All the Ieſuits of <hi>S. Omers</hi> vnanimouſly proteſt they neuer heard of any Letters but by the Narratiue: &amp; none went to <hi>Paris,</hi> on any ſuch account. ſee Atteſt. E.</p>
               <p>Narrat p. 12. §. 19. <hi>Letters ſubſcribed by</hi> Thom.

Whoſe negligence afflicted them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. I wonder you did not ſay, that Mt. <hi>White</hi> writ <hi>Lamentations</hi> on ſo dolefull a ſubject as that miſcarriage was: but that in ſuch a dolefull conjuncture he ſhould be ſo pleaſant, is very extraordinary to all, who know how far he was always from that <hi>Ioaking Leuity.</hi> The meane while both points of this Letter were as greate news to the Ieſuits at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> as to any in England, for not one of them euer heard of them, till you began to deceiue the world with your Periuryes.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:152770:20"/>
               <p>Narrat. p. 13. §. 20. Charles Peters <hi>on the</hi> 29. <hi>of</hi> Ianuary <hi>ſpoke treaſonable words of the late King</hi> Charles I.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here is another of your groundleſſe Periuryes. ſee Atteſt. O. The ſayd Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> proteſts he neuer heard nor dreamt of that foul Calumny till he ſaw your <hi>Narratiue.</hi> Which confirmes me in that opinion, that theſe ſtoryes you had from your Father during the troubles, which now you ſpreade vnder the name of Ieſuits, to make them odious, &amp; the Royal family contemptible. Let thoſe to whome it belongs conſider, whither this be ſuffrable in a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In your following <hi>Items</hi> 21.22.23. &amp; 24 we haue nothing but your cold Cabbadge ſerued vp againe, more Letters containing like treaſonable matters. Againſt all ſtand our old exceptions: that neuer were any ſuch Letters written Were euer any ſuch Letters intercepted? were euer any ſuch found? or any thing. like them? no. after two yeares &amp; a halfes ſearch the world is as far from any lyght as at firſt: &amp; all ſtill relyes on your worthleſſe word, or more worthleſſe Oath. All perſons named to haue ether written or receiued thoſe Letters proteſt they neuer heard any thing of them but from you. Soe I will ſcore them all vp together amongſt your Periuryes: &amp; paſſe to your 25. § where there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 16. §. 25. Th. White, <hi>&amp; other Ieſuits writ a Letter on the</hi> 10. <hi>of</hi> March, <hi>in which were very reproachfull contemptible expreſsions of the Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You throw here an <hi>Apple of Diſcord</hi> on purpoſe to ſow Diuiſion betwixt the Clergy &amp; the Society. But you will miſſe of your aim: for the words beare ſo euidently the Caracter of your wit, that we need not ſeek their Authour. Nether Mr. <hi>White,</hi> nor Ieſuit euer ſpoke ſuch words or entertained ſuch vndervaluing thoughts of that great Body, in which are many men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable for learning &amp; virtu, who by their infatigable labours haue eminently deſerued of God, the Church, &amp; their country. Hence I am perſwaded none of them euer harbour'd any ſuſpicion of ſuch words being really ſpoken being conſcious of their own worth, &amp; that they are aboue ſuch vnworthy reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which none can eaſily beleiue were truly ſayd of them, but who think they deſerue them. Had you moderated your Malice, &amp; mollified your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, you had found more credit, &amp; by aiming at leſſe hurt, would haue done more. Whereas by ouerdoing the thing you haue don iuſt nothing; &amp; your Calumny like the ſpe are in the fables cures the wound it makes.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, we haue thoſe generall exceptions againſt this pretended Letter Firſt that many Ieſuits ſigned it, &amp; ſecondly, that none aliue euer heard of it, but out of the <hi>Narratiue.</hi> ſee Atteſt. E.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 16. §. 26. <hi>The Deponent ſaw a Letter from</hi> Th. White, <hi>mentioning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152770:21"/>that Attempts had been made to aſsasfinate the King in the Park, &amp; on his way to the Parliament by</hi> William, <hi>&amp;</hi> Pickering, <hi>but opportunity did not offer it ſelf: for which the former was chidden, the later had twenty ſtrokes with a Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here is another ſleeueleſſe fable, of which no body euer heard, but by your Narratiue. I defire you to giue the world a reaſon, why <hi>William</hi> ſhould only be Chidden, &amp; <hi>Pickering</hi> whipt? or vpon what ſcore Mr. <hi>White</hi> ſhould be more meek to one, ouer whom he had iuriſdiction, then another ouer whom he had none? For <hi>William</hi> was you ſay his man, &amp; <hi>Pickering,</hi> was of another order. Again, why ſhould he be angry with them if <hi>opportunity did not offer its ſelf?</hi> If you had ſayd, an opportunity preſented it ſelf, &amp; was let ſlip, you had ſayd ſomething which myght diſpleaſe a man ſo hot vpon that deſign as you deſcribe M. <hi>White</hi> to be. I ſuppoſe in the fuller account, you threaten the world with, you will correct this abſurdity, as you haue done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſome others, in this.</p>
               <p>To this I find no reply, but only in I. P. that <hi>Pickering</hi> was vnder the hire of the Ieſuits, &amp; in <hi>Anonimus,</hi> that he was, a <hi>bigotted Preiſt.</hi> Which are as much to the purpoſe, as <hi>Grantham ſteeple to Godwinſanas,</hi> althô granted to be tru: when really they are falſe: for <hi>Pickering</hi> was not Preiſt; but a Lay-Brother, &amp; neuer was taken from the Chappel by Ieſuits.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 17. §. 27. <hi>Letters from</hi> T. White, <hi>&amp; others of the</hi> 5. <hi>of</hi> April, <hi>gaue an account, that</hi> W. M. <hi>&amp;</hi> M.

And that the Prouincial ſummoned a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſult, to be held at</hi> London. <hi>And that the Deponent was ſummoned to aſsiſt at it, as a Meſſenger from Father to Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru.

                  <hi>Prouincial Congregations</hi> all ouer the Society are held euery three yeares by their reſpectiue Prouincials. And the yeare 1678. was of courſe aſſigned for them.

               <p>The number of which it is Compoſed is not to exceede forty: which is made vp out of firſt the <hi>actuall ſuperiors;</hi> ſecondly the <hi>Procurators of the Prouince:</hi> thirdly, ſo many of the ancienteſt <hi>Profeſt Fathers,</hi> as with the others make vp that number.

But if this were all your employment; what need of your calling from beyond ſeas? Thoſe who had truſted Treaſonable Letters ſo long together to <hi>Common Poſts</hi> &amp; their <hi>Factors,</hi> myght haue truſted theſe <hi>Concerns</hi> to the firſt <hi>Porter</hi> they met: or haue made vſe of <hi>Honeſt William,</hi> or aukward <hi>Pickering,</hi> or ſome of thoſe thouſands, whom they had engaged in the Plot. I deſire you to ſatisfy theſe doubts.</p>
               <p>Narrat. <hi>Ibidem. A little after, they left the</hi> White-horſe Tauern, <hi>&amp; diuided themſelues into ſoueral</hi> clubs, <hi>or</hi> Companys. <hi>All which did contriue the death of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You are ſo puzzled with ſtudying to hammer out your Fables, that your head is giddy. Iuſt now, the <hi>Conſultors</hi> were diuided into <hi>Companys</hi> in the <hi>Tauern,</hi> &amp; you were buſyed in carrying their <hi>Concerns from company to Company.</hi> The next line, they diuided into Companys, after they left the <hi>Tauern.</hi> But the real Truth is, they neuer diuided into, or met in ſeueral <hi>Companys,</hi> that being againſt the nature of a Congregation according to all Orders; &amp; what ſoeuer had been in that nature acted, had been <hi>ipſo facto null.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what a fit ſubiect to deliberate on, doe you, the Taske-Maſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them! you relate <hi>the King's death,</hi> as a thing reſolued on about a twelue-month before, that all their Letters to <hi>France, Flandres, Spaine, Italy, Germany, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> &amp; ſeuerall parts of <hi>England,</hi> ſpoke of it, as a thing reſolued on: That men were hired to effect it by <hi>Piſtol,</hi> by <hi>Gun,</hi> by <hi>Dagger,</hi> by <hi>Poyſon:</hi> That ſome of theſe <hi>Ruffians</hi> had been puniſht for not performing what they had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. After all this, as <hi>Conſult,</hi> forſooth is called Fifty of the Prime <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſummoned to meet, to reſolue it. Iuſt as in ſom Barbarous nations, a man ſuſpected is hanged, &amp; then his cauſe examined, to ſee whether it were well don. When I conſider our Nation capable to be impoſed vpon by ſuch ridiculous ſtorys, I am half aſhamed to own my ſelf of it.</p>
               <p>Narrat. <hi>Ibidem. Within three or four days after, the Deponent went to</hi> S. Omers <hi>with the Fathers, that came from the other ſide of the Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſer. You could not return with them, firſt becauſe you were not in <hi>England</hi> all that time. Secondly becauſe thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> did not return together. The Rectors of <hi>Liege</hi> &amp; <hi>Watten</hi> returned immediatly to their ſeueral ſtations, the one by <hi>France,</hi> the other by <hi>Holland.</hi> He of <hi>Gant</hi> ſtayd ſome days in <hi>England</hi> but far from <hi>London.</hi> And theſe three were all that came from beyond ſeas to the <hi>Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the Congregation. The truth of the more eſſential parts, is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152770:23"/>euidenced by the Atteſtations already drawn vp. The reſt will be by others, when called for: there being not one word related by me, which is not known to many, who will depoſe it vpon Oath, when required.</p>

               <p>Narrat. pag. 19. §. 30. Th. White <hi>told</hi> Rich. Aſhby <hi>a miniſter had endeauoured to render Ieſuits odious, by Englishing their Morals, &amp; the Prouincial ſent the Deponent to</hi> England <hi>to kill the Tranſlator, which the Deponent vndertook to do, hauing</hi> 50. l. <hi>reward promiſsed him by the ſayd Prouincial. And the Prouincial ſayd, hee &amp; the Society</hi> London <hi>would procure the death of Dr.</hi> Stilling fleet, <hi>&amp;</hi> Pool.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. All this was ſpoken by Mr. <hi>White</hi> in the preſence of R. <hi>Ashby,</hi> &amp; your ſelf. Now the two firſt are gon to receiue their reward for their Actions &amp; ſuffrings in the other world. Yet the dying ſpeech of the former iuſtifyes him, &amp; the later before his death ſigned an Atteſtation that all this is falſe. See At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. E.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 19. §. 30. R. Aſhby <hi>told the Deponent that the Rector of</hi> Liege, <hi>when he was Procurator at</hi> Paris, <hi>did reconcile the late Lord Chancelour</hi> Hyde <hi>vpon his death bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. When your <hi>Narratiue</hi> firſt appeared, this was news to all Ieſuits in the World. The Rector of <hi>Liege</hi> declared, he neuer had the honour to ſee that Lord in his life: althô he would always haue been ready to do him any ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 20. §. 32. <hi>On the</hi> 23. <hi>of</hi> Iune, <hi>the Deponent was ſent for</hi> England, <hi>to attend the Motions of the Fathers in</hi> London, <hi>with</hi> 4. l. <hi>for his charges, &amp; a promiſe of</hi> 80. l. <hi>for his ſeruices in</hi> Spaine, <hi>&amp; elſe where,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obſeruat. Your <hi>Memory</hi> is as bad, as your <hi>Will.</hi> For not only in <hi>Ireland's</hi> triall pag. 20. but in the foregoing page of this <hi>Narratiue,</hi> you told vs, you were deſigned to kill the Tranſlator of the <hi>Ieſuits morals,</hi> with a promiſe of 50. l. if you did it. Now that Commiſſion is forgotten, &amp; the Reward too: and another pitcht vpon, <hi>to attend the motion of the Fathers.</hi> Tru it is, they did lend or giue you 4. l. to bear your charges to <hi>London,</hi> ether out of Compaſſion to a man, who myght otherwiſe haue ſtarued by the way, or vpon your promiſe to repay it, when you ſold your library. <hi>Whitebreads</hi> tryal. p. 43. But it is falſe, they recommended any buſineſſe to you, beſides the care of your ſaluation, which they thought you ſtood in need of. It is alſo fals they euer promiſt you 80. l. or that you euer did them any ſeruice in <hi>Spaine,</hi> except it was in exerciſing their Patience, by your vnſufferable manners, &amp; Conuerſation. You arriued at <hi>Valladolid</hi> on the 1. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 77. betwixt four &amp; fiue in the euening, from which time till <hi>October</hi> the 18.

What ſeruices here are to deſerue a Reward!</p>
               <p>For a further proofe of your lack of ſincerity, in this Relation. Many ſtill aliue can witneſſe, that things paſt in a far different manner betwixt you, &amp;

So for that time he diſmiſt you, with ſome good words in general, &amp; ſome good aduice: &amp; took time to informe vpon the place of your behauiour. This he quickly found to haue been intolerable as well to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, as to equalls: your words offenſiue, your carriage inſolent, your whole life irreligious without any ſign of the fear of God, or reſpect of men much better then your ſelf. He found, you had often been admoniſht to correct theſe faults; but in vain, for the hopes of your amendment vaniſht, aſſoon as the fear of a preſent diſmiſſion was paſt, althô with whining faces, great exteriour ſubmiſſion, &amp; ſober proteſtations, you had promiſt amendment, &amp; had profred to ſubmit to any correction, they ſhould enjoin for what was paſt. But of this laſt, ſuperiours made no other vſe, then to comfort themſelues with hopes, that you myght be at laſt brought to a more Chriſtian diſpoſition: for they would not permit, you ſhould vndergo the Pennance inflicted on Children, althô you ſeemingly deſired it, &amp; really deſerued it.</p>
               <p>The mean while, in diſcourſe with ſome aliue to whome you diſcouered your deſires of being a Ieſuit, they giuing you little encouragement to hope for good ſucceſſe, as indeed thoſe who knew you, had reaſon, you ſayd: <hi>I shall ether be a Ieſuit or a Iudas.</hi> And to another you ſayd: <hi>If am not a Ieſuit I shall be damned.</hi> When the <hi>Prouincial</hi> had informations as far, as was neceſſary to frame a Iudgment of your good parts &amp; qualitys, he cauſed you to be called to his Chamber, &amp; hauing told you what was blamed in you, &amp; aduiſed you to be for the future more conſiderate in your words, &amp; ciuil in your behauior, otherwiſe you would draw on your ſelfe ſome Miſchiefe or at leaſt be vnfit for any ciuil Company, he told you he thought it not conuenient to admit you into the ſociety. This refuſall you took as a great affront don to a man of your parts, that after all your hypocritical inſinuations you ſhould be reiected: So in a great Paſſion you ſayd: <hi>By the liuing God, I will be reuenged.</hi> The nyght before you went from <hi>S. Omers,</hi> you were found vpon the Altar in the Sodality Church, with your armes ſtreched out. And being asked what you did there, at that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable time? (it was late.) you anſwerd: <hi>I am taking my leaue of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Vpon this I will make no Commentarys, nor gueſſe at your meaning, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only relate, as an extrauagant Action, as indeed all yours are: &amp; I am of opinion, that thoſe, who conuerſe with you in <hi>England,</hi> ſince your return thither, can encreaſe this legend, if they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>By this manner of your commiſſion from <hi>S. Omers,</hi> the Reader will eaſily ſee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152770:24"/>how falſſe all your following relations are, of the Confidence of Ieſuits with you, &amp; their communicating their Letters, &amp; Treaſonable Deſigns to you. (ſee Atteſt. X.) So this myght ſerue for a generall anſwer. Yet I will follow you.</p>

               <p>Narrat. p. 22. §. 34. You giue vs a long pretended diſcourſe of <hi>R. Strange</hi> about the burning of <hi>London.</hi> You tell vs, as from his mouth, what hand the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> &amp; others had in it: &amp; what plunder they got.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. The dying ſpeeches of thoſe two worthy &amp; loyal men are an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant conuiction of this vntruth.</p>
               <p>Narrat. pag. 37. §. 38. Th. White <hi>writ to</hi> London <hi>to</hi> I.

               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Your Periury is Malicious &amp; Ridiculous. Malicious in charging ſuch an odious buſineſſe on the Jeſuits. Ridiculous in ſuppoſing that the Engliſh Iefuits haue ether credit or acquaintance with any of the ſtates of <hi>Holland:</hi> who would rather haue thought the quite contrary, had any Ieſuit told it them. Again what miſchance could (naturally) befall twelue Ieſuits in the way to <hi>Watten</hi> from <hi>S. Omers,</hi> &amp; that ſo great, as to diuert a buſineſſe of that concern, in caſe they had reſolued it? The day book of <hi>Watten</hi> ſhews that on that day 31. Iuly 1678. not one ſtranger, Ieſuit, or other, lodged there. Mr. <hi>Th. White</hi> was then at <hi>Liege:</hi> whence he let out on the 9. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for <hi>Louen</hi> ſo could not write from <hi>S. Omers?</hi> The certain truth is, the Ieſuits neuer had any ſuch deſign: there were no Ieſuits nor Ieſuit ſent about it: there neuer that year were at <hi>S. Omers</hi> at once ſix Ieſuits, who could be ſpared from the Seminary vpon any deſign. And laſtly they would neuer haue ſhewed you that Letter, you being by that time well known.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 27. §. 39. Th White <hi>in a Letter of the</hi> 10. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>acquainted the Fathers in</hi> London, <hi>that</hi> Ireland <hi>was arriued at</hi> S. Omers. <hi>And blamed them for not acquainting him, how Sir</hi> G. W. <hi>liked the Propoſall. Which Letter</hi> Blundel <hi>showed the Deponent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. <hi>Blundel</hi> proteſts he neuer heard of any ſuch Letter. ſee Atteſt. E. At that time, when you ſay Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> arriued at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> he was ſetting out from <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> or actually on his way. And <hi>White</hi> was on that betwixt <hi>S. Trons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Louen:</hi> ſo it is very improble he ſhould write Letters.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 28 § 40. Th. White <hi>writ that</hi> 365. <hi>should lye as low as ever</hi> 666. <hi>did, &amp; if Poyſon would not take the K. away, fire should: for Catholick Religion would neuer flourish, vnleſſe</hi> IHS. <hi>tooke this courſe.

               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. No Engliſh Ieſuits euer vſed any ſuch Cypher. ſee Atteſt. C. ſo this whole §. is euidently a Periury.</p>
               <p>Natrat. p. 28. § 41. I Fenwick <hi>told the Deponent that the</hi> Ieſuits, <hi>haue</hi> 6000. l. per àn. <hi>&amp;</hi> 100000. l. <hi>in bank: &amp; lend mony at</hi> 50. per cent. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:152770:26"/>
               <p>Obſeru. Here is a great vntruth, without any proof, but your only word. It would almoſt empty the two greateſt priuate purſes in <hi>England</hi> to make vp, what the Ieſuits want of that ſum, as I am aſſured. And were <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſo voyd of conſcience &amp; ſhame, as to demand 50. <hi>per cent,</hi> I am perſwaded there are none ſo voyd of ſenſe, as to giue it.</p>
               <p>Narrat p. 29. §. 42. <hi>Four</hi> Ieſuits <hi>ſayd, they were reſolued to rayſe a Commotion in</hi> England, <hi>&amp;</hi> Scotland, <hi>which alſo by ſeueral Letters shewd to the Deponent in</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt <hi>appeared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here you aduance another vntruth, without any ſign of Truth. Produce any one of thoſe many Letters, for Publick ſatisfaction: which you would not haue let paſſe out of your hands, ſeing you were engaged all the firſt part of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in compoſing your <hi>Narratiue,</hi> it hauing been, as you ſay, on the 13. of that month preſented to his Maieſty. What a commotion you haue ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>England</hi> all the World ſees. How will you anſwer this, if you cannot le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally proue one word of your Depoſition? will your ſpyght againſt Ieſuits iuſtify all Periuryes, diſturbances of the nation, &amp; breaking the publick Peace? Hath the <hi>hatred of the Ieſuits</hi> the vertu, of the <hi>tru loue of God to couer all ſins?</hi> 1. Pet. 4.8. If not, you are in danger</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 29. §. 43. F. Moore &amp; F. Sanders, alias Brown <hi>were ſent to</hi> Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tland <hi>to preach to the diſaffected</hi> Scots, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. whom you mean, God knows, for no Ieſuit that I can hear of knows any of thoſe names: nor of any Engliſh Ieſuit ſent to preach in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 29. §. 44. <hi>The Ieſuits purchaſe ſecrets to ſend to</hi> P. Leſhee, <hi>&amp; Keep in ſee the Clerks of Parliament, &amp; Counſil, to that intent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. All this is fals. Neuer any Ieſuits in <hi>England</hi> kept correſpondence ether directly or indirectly with <hi>P. de la Chaize.</hi> And it is needleſſe to keep Clerks in fee, whileſt the common <hi>Coffee houſes,</hi> thoſe Nurſeryes of ſedition, ſtand.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 30. §. 45. <hi>Theſe</hi> Ieſuits <hi>driue ſeueral trades in town as</hi> Marchants, Tobacconiſts, Goldſmiths, ſcriueners: <hi>by ſome</hi> ſcriueners <hi>they diſcouer Men's eſtates; by others, their Religion. Which the Deponent heard from</hi> Iohn Keynes.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. <hi>I. Keynes</hi> is not ſo weak as to tell ſuch vntruth what Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is there that Men who haue paſt 20. or 25 yeares poring on a book ſhould be fit for ſuch trades? Or that ſome <hi>ſcriueners</hi> ſhould Keep Regiſters of men's Religion? Heretofore ſome, as giddy headed, as your ſelf, ſayd all <hi>Redcoates</hi> were <hi>Ieſuits:</hi> you now ſay tradeſmen are ſuch. I expect, that ſome other one day will ſay the ſame of all the Citty &amp; country.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 30. §. 46. <hi>Letters from</hi> S. Omers <hi>expreſt great Ioy, that Sir</hi> G. W. <hi>had taken the buſineſſe in hand. Yet ordred that</hi> Pickering <hi>&amp;</hi> William <hi>should not deſiſt.</hi>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:152770:26"/>
               <p>Obſeru. It is falſſe that euer Sir G. W. vndertook that buſineſſe as appeares by the Publick verdict of the Jury at his triall. It is falſſe that <hi>Pickering,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> euer deſigned any ſuch thing, as appeared by their dying ſpeeches: &amp; it is falſſe there euer was any ſuch Letter, by Proteſtation of the Ieſuits of <hi>S. Omers.</hi> ſee Atteſt. E.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 31. §. 47. <hi>Becauſe</hi> William Berry <hi>was about to print ſomething in Vindication of the Oaths,</hi> B. Langworth, <hi>&amp; others</hi> Ieſuits offred 10. l. to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent to get him killed.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. The <hi>Ieſuits</hi> neuer thought themſelues much concerned in what <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Berry</hi> did or could do. His vnconſtant Nature appeares by his frequent changes, firſt a Proteſtant Miniſter, then a Papiſt, after a Ieſuit, them a ſecular, then a Proteſtant Miniſter, then pretended Catholick, &amp; Penitent. And what next God knows. He profeſſes he thinks himſelf able to inuent a wiſer Religion, then ether <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> or <hi>Popery.</hi> He was once ſtark mad: &amp; is euer ſince cracked. You ſhew in this point ſomething of gratitude: He brought you firſt to ſome <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> &amp; repreſented you as a conſiderable perſon, who had loſt much for your Religion, &amp; was in danger on that ſcore: to requite this courteſy, you bring him to Proteſtants, &amp; to recommend him by the ſame topick, you framed this lye, repreſenting him as a conſiderable man, vpon whoſe head the Ieſuits had put a Tally. Thus theſe two ſcabby Creatures claw one another!</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 31. §. 48. Richard Heath <hi>a Lay brother of the</hi> Ieſuits <hi>held treaſonable diſcourſe of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. There nether is at preſent, or hath been theſe laſt ten yeares, any <hi>Richard Heath</hi> of the ſociety. There is indeed one <hi>Heath;</hi> but he hath been at <hi>Liege</hi> euer ſince the 2. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1678. ſo could not ſpeak in your hearing in <hi>London,</hi> on the 9. <hi>Auguſt</hi> of that year.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 31. §. 49. Iohn Groues <hi>gaue the Deponent an account of the firing of</hi> Southwark <hi>as don by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Narrat. <hi>Ibidem,</hi> &amp; p. 33. §. 52. <hi>You giue an account of many treaſonable Letters, written in</hi> Cyphers <hi>in which</hi> 48. <hi>ſtands for the King.</hi> Mum &amp; chocolate, <hi>for the</hi> houſe of Lords: barley broth, <hi>for that of</hi> Commons: Magpyes <hi>for</hi> Biſhops, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. The Ieſuits neuer had any <hi>Cypher.</hi> ſee Atteſt. C. ſince 1636. they they haue had no <hi>Cypher,</hi> but one, whereof a copy was taken with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincial's Papers. To this I appeal for a further confutation of this vntruth.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 35. §. 53. Smith, <hi>alay-brother of the</hi> Ieſuits <hi>told the Deponent, as from</hi> Mr. Ieniſon, <hi>that if the Catholicks had courage enough, they myght riſe, &amp; cut the throates of</hi> 100000. <hi>Proteſtants in</hi> London.</p>
               <p>Obſeruat. Here you deliuer three Periurys: the firſt, that <hi>Smith is a Ieſuit.</hi> He neuer was, nor is one.</p>
               <p>The 2. that <hi>Ieniſon ſayd thoſe words.</hi> His diſcretion, peacable &amp; quiet temper is well known to all, who knew him.</p>
               <p>The 3. that ſuch a Butcherey could be effected. This is a <hi>Bug beare</hi> fit to fryght only children, &amp; fooles with. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in number compared to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are in London aboue two hundred, to one. And if we conſider the aduantage of Authority, Armes, watches, &amp; conueniences to meet, which are all on their ſide, we may reckon them 1000. nay ten thouſand to one.

               </head>
               <p>NArrat. p. 35. §. 54. Medburn, Penny, Mannock, Sharp, Seddon, Smith, Euerard: Iones, Kemmaſh, <hi>at a Club, ſayd</hi> the <hi>houſe of Commons was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil's repreſentatiue, not the Nations: the Deponent was ordred by the Ieſuits to giue them great Reſpects, &amp; thanks in their Names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You bring new Perſons on the ſtage, &amp; ſhew that all your Malice is not ſpent vpon <hi>Ieſuits;</hi> but ſhew you haue ſtore enough for others, euen for the whole Nation, which many others haue experienced, &amp; more will find, if you are permitted to go on, as you haue begun. This ſtory is a ridiculous vntruth 1. becauſe the club would little value <hi>Ieſuits</hi> thanks 2. becauſe <hi>Ieſuits</hi> would neuer giue any commiſſion to you. 3. becauſe all is falſe.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 36. § 55. Ieniſon <hi>ſayd that if the K. did not become</hi> R. C. <hi>(Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik) he should not long be</hi> C. R.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. This a groundleſſe vntruth. Yet had he ſayd any ſuch thing, it had been becauſe of Presbiterians; not of Papiſts. None but ſuch, as are willfully blind can miſſe that Party, which endangers Monarky it ſelf. What character <hi>K. Iames</hi> in his <hi>Baſilicon doron</hi> gaue of the Presbiterians all know: Which is by their vn interrupted ſeditious practices confirmed. Whither theſe do not boad the down fall of Monark, if not preuented in time, I leaue the Couſidering world to Iudge, &amp; thoſe, to prouide a remedy, whom it concerns. For in fine, let them affect the voice of <hi>la ob</hi> neuer ſo much, their hand are ſtill the hands of <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 36. §. 56. <hi>A packet from the Prouincial, the Rector, Procurator, Fathers, &amp; maſters of Humanity of</hi> S. Omers, <hi>ſpecifyed, that the twelue</hi> Ieſuits <hi>were got into</hi> Holland, <hi>to cauſe a commotion there &amp; that</hi> Apple-tree Will (<hi>that is the</hi> P. <hi>of</hi> Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge) <hi>should not be great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. to make your impertinence more conſpicuous, you ſhould haue ſayd, that the lay brothers, their ſeruants, &amp; their great Dog had written too. It is falſe, that any went into <hi>Holland</hi> And it is falſe that any Engliſh Ieſuits called Perſons of that hygh ranke of the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> by ſuch a name.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 37. §. 57. I Fenwick <hi>told the Deponent,</hi> he had <hi>written to</hi> S. Omers,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152770:28"/>
                  <hi>that the</hi> K. <hi>was gon to</hi> Windſore, <hi>&amp; that</hi> Honeſt William, <hi>&amp; the</hi> Fathers, <hi>were ready to attend the court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You can aduance nothing without the mixture of an vntruth. His Majeſty's Iourny being known to all the Kingdom, probably myght be put into a Letter. Yet that <hi>Fenwicke</hi> ſhould write of <hi>William,</hi> or the <hi>Fathers</hi> following him, is falſe. As alſo, that <hi>Fenwicke</hi> euer communicated to you the contents of any Letter. He knew you: &amp; that was enough.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 37 §. 58 I. Keynes <hi>preacht a treaſonable ſermon, at which were preſent twelue men of quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here in a blank Accuſation you lay a traine to blow vp any noble man, whom you, or others like you, ſhall hereafter mark out for deſtruction. It is only ſwearing that Noble-man was of the twelue, &amp; his buſineſſe is done. That vſe was made of alike accuſation of the four Ruffians, hired to kill the King: &amp; the like we may ſee of this, if Periury continue Paramount, &amp; knaues be rewarded.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 38. §. 59. Keynes, <hi>&amp;</hi> Fenwicke <hi>aduiſed a Gentleman in, or about</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to remoue thence, leaſt God should deſtroy him with the ſinners of that Citty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. That canting phraſe, not vſed by Ieſuits; but familiar to <hi>Oates,</hi> &amp; Presbiterian Miniſters, ſhewes whence it came. Keynes proteſts, he neuer ſayd any ſuch thing: &amp; any man, who knows both, will take his word, before your Oath.</p>
               <p>Narrat p. 38. §. 60. I Keynes <hi>ſayd, it was endeauoured to diſpatch</hi> 48. <hi>at</hi> Winſore. <hi>That</hi> Mr. Corker, <hi>&amp; other</hi> Benedictins <hi>had promiſt</hi> 6000. l. <hi>for the Deſign. That two theſe owned it, &amp; that their buſineſſe was to remoue the</hi> Stuarts <hi>out of the way, &amp; that</hi> Mr. Coniers <hi>layd</hi> 100. l. <hi>the King should not liue to eate any more Chriſt-maſſe-Pyes. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Now our Poet begins to bring the <hi>Benedictins</hi> on the ſtage, &amp; next to <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> they bear the greateſt part, for what reaſon I know not, except it be becauſe you deſired earneſtly to be admitted to their Holy order, &amp; were by them refuſed. This was alleadged againſt Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi> &amp; he was cleared by the verdict of the Court. Mr. <hi>Coniers</hi> I beleiue would ſubmit to a tryall, if his Preiſt-hood myght be layd aſide.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 40. §. 61. Keynes <hi>took the Deponent to an aſſembly of the</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, <hi>where ſix were met in the name of the reſt with their Prouincial, to comply with the Fathers of the Society. There met alſo fiue</hi> Ieſuits. <hi>Keynes demanded of the</hi> Dominicans <hi>mony to carry on the buſineſs of Killing the King. The</hi> Dominicans <hi>anſwered they were poor? but would giue their aſsiſtance, &amp; counſel. Hence the Deponent was ſent with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152770:28"/>propoſals to the</hi> Carmelits: <hi>who anſwered, their Prayers to God, &amp; our B. Lady should not be wanting: &amp; that was all they could giue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here are two whole Religious orders conſiſting of many vertuous men, made guilty of a moſt haynous crime vpon your worthleſſe word, &amp; more worthleſſe Oath. Thoſe who know, what emulations haue been, &amp; ſtill are, betwixt the two learned Orders, <hi>Dominicans,</hi> &amp; Ieſuits, will ſcarce beleiue that thoſe ſhould meet <hi>to comply with theſe.</hi> And no rational man will beleiue, that all thoſe men ſhould at firſt ſyght treat ſuch things before you, a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or too well known to be truſted with any thing.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 41. §. 62. Blundel <hi>ſayd, his Workemen wanted Oyle: by which is meant sheepes fat,</hi> Coniers <hi>ſayd the Hill people were fooles to ſet vpon</hi> 48. <hi>at</hi> Windſore: <hi>but he would ſpeak to his worship in other language, then in</hi> Tormentilio. <hi>But would burn his shirt, if it knew how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeruat. <hi>Blundel</hi> neuer had any workmen. ſee Atteſt. S. And nether he, nor <hi>Coniers</hi> euer ſpoke ſuch words.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 42. §. 63. <hi>On the</hi> 21. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt. <hi>a Conſult was held by</hi> Ieſuits <hi>&amp;</hi> Benedictins <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>about Letters from</hi> Talbot <hi>Arch Bishop of</hi> Dublin, <hi>which contained that four</hi> Ieſuits <hi>had vndertaken to kill the D. of</hi> Ormond <hi>And if they fayled</hi> Fogorthy <hi>should ſucceed; And that a Legat in</hi> Ireland <hi>aſserted the Popes ryght to that Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here you preſent another blank accuſation to be filled with any <hi>Benedictin,</hi> or <hi>Ieſuit</hi> when you pleaſe. It was accordingly charged vpon Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> althô he was at <hi>Woluerhampton</hi> in <hi>Stafforshire</hi> on that very day. (ſee Atteſt. T.) &amp; vpon Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi> of which he was, at this triall acquittted) as appeares by their ſeuerall tryals. <hi>Dr Fogorthy</hi> had Cured you of a venereal ſickneſſe, &amp; you reward him with this Accuſation, as Vipers bite the breaſt which warmes them. You ſay, you had this acount from <hi>Keynes</hi> &amp; <hi>Blundel:</hi> &amp; they both are ready to ſwear they had had it from your <hi>Narratiue,</hi> as neuer hauing heard of it, till this appeared.</p>
               <p>Narrat. pag. 43 §. 64. <hi>That</hi> Fogarthy <hi>is a maine Agent in this Hellish Plot: was preſent when Sir</hi> G W <hi>was contracted with That he told the Deponent, he had hired the four</hi> Iriſh <hi>Ruffians, to mind the King's poſtures, at</hi> Windſore.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. We thought your attendance on <hi>D. Fogorthy,</hi> was to get your ſelf cured of your fulſome diſeaſe; but it ſeemes it was to get informations of the Plot. If the other were intended, you haue payd off your Doctor compleatly: euen as you haue don the Jeſuits, who releiued you in your want. Your whole report of the Pretended Conſult, is one vntruth. The contract with Sir G. W. a ſecond. The hiring of the four Ruffians, a third.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:152770:29"/>
               <p>We haue ſeen what vſe may be made of theſe blank Accuſations. This, of the four <hi>Ruffians</hi> was filled by <hi>Ieniſon's</hi> naming four Innocent Perſons, for no other reaſon, but that he myght get a falſe witneſſe's reward where with to pay his debts, &amp; ſupply his wants of mony. And who can aſſure himſelf, his name ſhall not ſhortly be inſerted into ſome of the other blanks? It is euident to the whole world, that ſome Innocent Perſons haue been accuſed, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, meerely becauſe it pleaſed theſe King's Euidences. No man can be ſecure, who ſtands in the way of a <hi>Mad Dog,</hi> or an <hi>Impudent lying Witneſse,</hi> as long as the clamours of the Rabble are ſo lowd, that nether Iuſtice, nor Reaſon can be heard. Thoſe are wiſeſt, who embraced a voluntary Baniſhment, foreſeing no ſecurity, as long as this Plague raignes. Let thoſe who ſtayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, look to themſelues as they can: they will neuer be ſecure, vntill you be gagged, or all credit denyed you.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 44. §. 65. <hi>That the Deponent at</hi> Madrid <hi>had ſeen the Lord Embaſsador, Sir</hi> William Godolphin, <hi>at maſſe: &amp; was perſonally informed by the Arch Bishop of</hi> Tuam, <hi>that the ſayd Embaſſador holds great correſpondence with that Arch-Bishop, &amp; a Ieſuit. That a Ieſuit had read to him Philoſophy, &amp; Diuinity. That</hi> Swiman, <hi>a Ieſuit in a Letter to the Deponent, of the</hi> 30. <hi>of</hi> Iuly <hi>new ſtile, did ſpecify, that Sir</hi> William <hi>was as induſtrious as any Man could be, to anſwer the expectation of the Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here you giue vs as many Periuryes, as Periods. For 1. It is falſe, you euer were at <hi>Madrid.</hi> ſee Atteſt. A. B. L. N.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is falſe, that you euer ſaw the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tuam</hi> (ſee Atteſt A.) or F. <hi>Swiman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is falſe you euer had any diſcourſe with ether of them. For all the time you were in <hi>Spain,</hi> they were not at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> nor you out of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is falſe you euer ſaw Sir <hi>William</hi> at Maſſe: for he reſiding, according to his ſouueraign's order in <hi>Madrid,</hi> how could you ſee him, who neuer were there?</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is falſe, that Arch-biſhop (the ſame of the Ieſuit) euer had any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence concerning affaires of ſtate with the ſayd Lord Embaſſador. ſee Atteſt. A.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is falſe, that euer F. <hi>Sviman</hi> writ any ſuch Letter to the Deponent. J challenge you to produce, at leſt that Letter, which being directed to your ſelfe, you myght without offence to any, or ſuſpition, haue Kept. And it being written at <hi>Madrid</hi> on the 30. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> could not come to your hands till about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that very time, or after it, when your <hi>Narratiue</hi> was preſented to the King. It is incredible that you ſhould make away ſuch a Letter, which would be, at leaſt, ſome Confirmation beſides your word,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152770:29"/>of this great aſſayre, of which hitherto we haue ſeene no other ground, but that: your not ſhewing this Letter will be looked on as a conuiction, there neuer was any ſuch.</p>
               <p>Jf the Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> or that Jeſuit being ſubiects of the King of <hi>England,</hi> wayted on, &amp; profred their ſeruice to his Majeſty's Embaſſador, they did but their Duty. And if his Lordſhip receiued them ciuilly, hauing no expreſſe order to the contrary, I hope none are ſo barbarous, as to blame him for it, But that there euer paſt any intimate correſpondence, chiefly relating to any Publick concern, it is abſolutely falſe. ſee Atteſt. A.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt take notice of the diſingenuity of the Managers of the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Lord of <hi>Stafford,</hi> p. 30. &amp; 31. of that trial; who produce one to proue, that <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>Valladolid.</hi> Which was neuer denyed by vs: althô Mr. <hi>Treby</hi> is pleaſed to ſay p. 31. <hi>it had been controuerted, whither he had euer been in Spaine.</hi> So if they cannot proue what we deny, they will make vs deny, what they can proue.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 45. §. 66. <hi>On the</hi> 22. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt. <hi>in the name of the Prouincial, &amp; the ſociety, mony was ſent by a ſeruant of theirs, to ſupply the Charges of the four Ruffians at</hi> Windſore. <hi>The ſum was eyghty Pound, which the Deponent ſaw told.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Here is another blank to receiue any man's name, for whom you, or your aſſociats, ſhall haue a ſpyght. <hi>A ſeruant of theirs!</hi> ſuch ſhall any man be, when you pleaſe. <hi>In the name of the whole Society!</hi> This you ſay to inuolue all in the guilt, althô had you had the thouſanth part of that intimacy with Ieſuits, to which you pretend, you would know, that the Prouincial alone is anſwerable for his actions, &amp; none elſe.</p>
               <p>But where was this mony told? on the 28. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> it was at <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> (Coleman's trial p. 24.) on the 7. of <hi>December,</hi> it was at Harcourt's lodgings. (Ireland's trial p. 25.) on the 13. of <hi>Iune,</hi> it was againe at <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> (White breades trial. p. 16.) What do theſe contradictions proue, but that the whole ſtory is built on your fancy, &amp; therefore ſhifts the ſcene, as oft as that changes? &amp; how come your Patrones to let them paſſe abroad vncorrected, but that in this, God blinded them, that they myght remain to poſterity an euerlaſting vnanſwerable proofe of the vnjuſtice of their Iudgments?</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 45. § 67. Iohn Groue <hi>brought an order from</hi> Harcout, I. K. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Blundel, <hi>Mr.</hi> Ienniſon, M. W. B. L. <hi>&amp; four other Ieſuits, that lay at</hi> Sommerſet <hi>houſe, to pray the Prouincial to acquaint</hi> Leſhee <hi>how things ſtood in</hi> Ireland: <hi>that the Deponent read the Memorial, &amp; ſaw their names. At two in the afternoon he met thoſe Fathers at</hi> Mrs. Sanders: <hi>who appointed him a meeting at four in the afternoon, at</hi> Mr. Keynes's: <hi>where he ſaw Letters from Blundel,</hi> I. F. <hi>&amp; one from</hi> F. Ireland <hi>at</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:152770:30"/>S. Omers. <hi>Had an account of fourſcore Letters written to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Obſeru. Here are many Periuryes. The firſt, that four Ieſuits lodged at <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet Houſe.</hi> I am credibly informed, that not one Engliſh Ieſuit lodged there at that time, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>The 2. that there was any ſuch meſſage. It is a meer fable. ſee Atteſt. R. S.</p>
               <p>The 3. that <hi>F. Ireland</hi> writ from <hi>S. Omers.</hi> In his triall he was ſayd to be in <hi>London</hi> about that time. Yet he was nether at <hi>S. Omers,</hi> nor <hi>London;</hi> but in <hi>Staffordshire.</hi> ſee Atteſt. T. ſo all that Letter is feyghned, vnleſſe you will haue him in many places at once, which you deny Chriſt's body can be.</p>
               <p>The 4. that you ſaw Letters from <hi>Blundel. Blundel</hi> was one of thoſe, who met you: the ſame of J. F. But it ſeemes they writ their Letters, &amp; brought them themſelues.</p>
               <p>The 5. that they would haue any informations ſent by <hi>P. de la Chaize</hi> to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 6. that 440. ſtands for <hi>Winſore.</hi> There neuer was amongſt Ieſuits any ſuch Cypher. ſee Atteſt. C.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 48. §. 68. <hi>The ſame day, the Deponent went to Dr.</hi> Tonge's: <hi>but not finding him, he went into Gray's-Inne Walkes, &amp; met there with</hi> Mr. Coniers, <hi>who shew'd him a Dagger, with which he intended to kill the King by ſtabbing through his cloake.</hi> And that thence <hi>he went to</hi> Dr. Tonge's, <hi>&amp; met him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Is it not ſtrang, that a man, who two days before, (on the 20. of Auguſt, as may be ſeene §. 62.) was reſolued to Keepe his way ſo ſecret, as to ſay <hi>he would burne his shirt, if it knew any thing of it,</hi> would ſo frankly diſcouer it, &amp; brandiſh his Dagger, &amp; that in a place, as open, as a favre? He had been mad, if he had done ſoe, &amp; thoſe are fooles, who can beleiue he did. Mr. <hi>Coniers</hi> giues a far different account of that conference: <hi>that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of your Pouerty, which forced you to walke there ſometimetimes in ſtead of a dinner: that you wondred no better Prouiſion was made in the Roman Church for men of your parts, that you had been employed to preach before the Iudges that you had loſt</hi> 4. <hi>or</hi> 500. l. <hi>a yeare for your Religion: that the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>offred you great preferments, vpon condition you would return to the Ch. of</hi> England: &amp;c. <hi>And deſired him to prefer you to teach ſome Gentleman's children: that meate, drink &amp;</hi> 10. l. <hi>a yeare would ſatisfy you.</hi> ſee Atteſt.

               <p>Jt ſeemes this 22. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was pretty well employed, althô you had nether eate, nor drunk, nor ſtopt all the day long, you go to Mr. <hi>Harcourt's</hi> in Duke ſtreete, &amp; <hi>Wildhouſe,</hi> &amp; in both places find the ſame Perſons, prouiding the ſame 80. guinys for the Ruffians, &amp; <hi>Cilman</hi> giuing the ſame Guiny to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: thence you go to <hi>Fenwick's</hi> lodging, there you heare the commiſſion ſent to <hi>Fenwick</hi> to deſire the Prouincial to informe <hi>Leshee</hi> with the Iriſh affayres.

Then you return to Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> &amp; meet him.

               <p>Narrat. p. 48 §. 71.

               <p>Obſeru. <hi>Blundel</hi> proteſts he neuer heard of any ſuch Paper. <hi>Fenwick's</hi> chamber was ſearched, all his Papers ſeized on, &amp; carefully examined, &amp; nothing like this found. So I leaue you to make it out, by any thing beſides your word: which there is little reaſon to eſteem.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p 50. §. 72. Blundel <hi>shewd the Deponent, a Bull, by which the two Arch-Bishopricks,</hi> 21. <hi>Bithopriches, two Abbys, &amp; ſix Deanryes are diſpoſed of.</hi> Nay there is <hi>not one Prebendary, or other place vndiſpoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. You ſhew as much skill in the <hi>Cancellaria</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as in the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuits.</hi> That ſuch Benefices ſhould be diſpoſed of without the King's conſent! All contained in one Bull! This Bull ſo careleſſely ſent, ſo negligently kept, ſo cauſeleſſely produced! not one Benefice left for ſuch as may deſerue well in that great change!

Thoſe who can ſwallow theſe mountaines of incredibilitys, neede to ſtraine nothing.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 52. §. 73. <hi>That the Deponent ſaw a Packet from the Fathers met at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>acquainting them, that</hi> 8000. <hi>Papiſts were ready to riſe, &amp; aſsiſt the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſcots, when required by the Scotch Ieſuits there.

               <p>Obſeru. Not one tru word. For 1. there neuer was a meeting of Engliſh Ieſuits at Edinburgh. Nor 2. any Engliſh Ieſuits in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor 3. <hi>Louel,</hi> nor 4. any man of his euer there. Nor 5. any correſpondence of Engliſh <hi>Ieſuits</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor 6. any knowledge of affayres of that Kingdom, but from the publick Gazettes.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 53. §. 74. The White <hi>writ from</hi> S. Omers <hi>on the</hi> 4. <hi>of</hi> September nou. ſtil. <hi>to</hi> Rich.

And that they were to carry themſelues as</hi> Non-Conformiſt Miniſters <hi>amongſt the</hi> Presbiterians.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. We haue here many Periuryes. Firſt there is no <hi>Rich. Blundel</hi> amonſt the Engliſh Ieſuits. 2. there neuer was any ſuch Letter receiued. ſee Atteſt. S.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152770:31"/>3. the ſum of 1000. l. for ſuch a deſign is ridiculous 4. that <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſhould paſſe for <hi>Non Conformiſt Miniſters.</hi> No Ieſuits takes the quality of any <hi>Miniſter</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>Yet it were for the publick good, that this vntruth were beleiued by the <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> to diminiſh the credit of thoſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who are <hi>Flabella ſeditionum, Trumpetters of ſedition,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Were they ſilenced by that loſſe of credit, the Publick would enjoy more quiet, then can be hoped for, whileſt thoſe factions Men haue influence on ſo Proud, ſo ſtubborn, &amp; ſo Potent a part of the Nation. Jf ſuch vſe were made of this Periury, it would, ſcorpion like, cure the poyſon it ſpreades.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 35. §. 75. <hi>That</hi> Th. White <hi>writ to</hi> Blundel, <hi>that ſome diſcouery of the plot had been made; yet he should not deſiſt the buſineſſe in hand. That he should thank</hi> Fogorthy <hi>for his care of the buſineſſe of</hi> 48. <hi>the K. as alſo thoſe in</hi> Ireland, <hi>for whoſe good ſucceſſe he would pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. It is falſe, there euer was any ſuch Letter. ſee Atteſt. S. Had there been ſo horrid a Plot, as you deſcribe, &amp; he heard it was diſcouered, he ſhould haue ordred all the Conſpirators to deſiſt, ſecure their Perſons, make away their Papers, &amp; do ſome of thoſe things, which Fear on ſuch occaſions ſuggeſts to Guilty Perſons. But to command them to go on, is Non-ſenſe: &amp; none can beleiue it, but ſuch as haue as ſhallow heads, &amp; as little common ſenſe, as the Inuentor of theſe Fables. Here again 48. is taken for the King, a thing vnheard of amongſt <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> It is no leſſe vnreaſonable, that thanks ſhould be ordred to <hi>Fogorthy,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Irish.</hi> Had you ſayd, he (Mr. <hi>White</hi>) had deſired their Prayers, for the Preſeruation of himſelf &amp; his whole Prouince, &amp; all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, you myght haue been beleiued, this carrying ſome Proportion with the ſtate into which they were vnauoydably entring. But that black Malice which appeares in you, &amp; common ſenſe, or the vſe of ryght Reaſon, are inconſiſtent in the ſame mind. God darkning the vnderſtanding, when man leaues his Wil to the workings of Malice: that the vntruths, they ſpread, may be more eaſily diſcouered, &amp; more cleerely confuted.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 54. §. 76. <hi>The Prouincial came to</hi> London <hi>on the third day of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>at nyght: and the Deponent was ordred to wayt on him the next day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. In <hi>Ireland's</hi> tryal p. 25. you ſwore he was at ſupper, when you came, &amp; after ſupper admitted you, &amp; treated you, as the next §. relates. Here you ſay, you were remitted till the next day.</p>
               <p>Narrat. p. 54. § 77. <hi>That the Deponent went to the Prouincial on the</hi> 4. <hi>of</hi> Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember <hi>who asked:</hi> with what face he could looke on him, ſince he <hi>had betrayed them? &amp; ſtruck him with his cane, gaue him a box on the Ear. Yet he would be reconciled to him again, if he would diſcouer the Parſon, who went with him to the King, whom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152770:32"/>he would have ſecured, &amp; killed. That the Deponent should prepare to be gon beyond ſeas, within fourteen days: that he would pay for his coach, &amp; lodgings on the read, that he myght not cheat them. Told him his Innes at</hi> Sittingburg, <hi>Douer, &amp;</hi> Callice. <hi>And that</hi> Rich. Blundel <hi>was to take care for the burning of</hi> Wapping, <hi>in the Deponents room.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſeru. Neuer any ſuch incoherent non ſenſe came from any man in his Wits None, who knew Mr. <hi>White,</hi> euen when in his vigour, will beleiue it probable, that he ſhould beat ſo ſtout a man, as you ſhew your ſelfe: much leſſe, when he was in ſo weak a condition, as he came in to <hi>London,</hi> as being almoſt caſt down by the ſickneſſe contracted at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> which carryed away his <hi>Sodus, Mieo,</hi> &amp; brought him to death's dore. Is it probable, that either he, who could ſcarce ſtand, ſhould haue ſo much Courage, as to beat you? or you ſo much Patience, as to bear it, from a man, whom you could run down with a finger? let that paſſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>White</hi> hauing vented his vndigeſted choler, comes to himſelf again, &amp; offers to for giue what is paſt, vpon condition <hi>you would diſcouer the Parſon, who went with you to the King: telling you, he would haue him ſecured, &amp; killed. And that when you had betrayed your freind to death, you should be ſent beyond ſeas,</hi> there to receiue a like reward doubtleſſe. And he candidly tells you, you ſhould nor deceiue him, no: &amp; for that reaſon, he would giue you no mony for your Iourny; but would hire you a coach, &amp; defray your charge on the way. Iuſt as if a Conſtable ſhould bid a Theife firſt to diſcouer his fellow, whom he would hang: &amp; then go to ſuch a place, where he would find ſome men ready to ſeize on him, &amp; ſecure him from eſcaping out of their hands, would carry him to a ſafe lodging, which would be payd for him by the Publick. Wonderous Wife! Yet this is not all. As if Mr. <hi>White</hi> had forgotten, that you endeauoured to preuent the miſcheife intended to <hi>Weſiminſter,</hi> by the diſcouery you had made of it; but ſtill were a <hi>Zealous conſpirator:</hi> he bids you not to be ſolicitous for your ſhare of that worke of Darkneſſe, becauſe another would ſupply your place.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire of thoſe, who can beleiue this nonſenſe, one fauour; which I think cannot in Iuſtice be denyed, that when euer they hear Ieſuits called <hi>Politians,</hi> they ſay it is a Calumny: for they are the ſtupideſt, ſillyeſt creatures, that walk on the face of the Earth. For ſuch muſt be the cheifeſt of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>What I know of that meeting, is this. You made your addreſſes again to Mr <hi>White</hi> after his return to <hi>London,</hi> to be admitted into the ſociety But your Petition was as coldly receiued, as before. Then you deſired à Gentleman to intercede for you, ether to procure your admiſſion, or a Penſion to ſubſiſt with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152770:32"/>beyond ſeas: &amp; told him, that if either of theſe things were granted, you would giue vp to him an Accuſation conſiſting of aboue fifty articles, which at the next Parliament would be exhibited againſt the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> which you ſayd, <hi>you knew would be beleiued, althô they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

At leaſt for theſe reaſons Mr <hi>White</hi> reſolued to leaue you to your own courſes, to vent your malice, as you had begun, &amp; would continu: relying the mean while vpon his own Innocency, the Iuſtice of the nation, &amp; the Mercy of the King: arming himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly he kept his ordinary lodging, remoued no Papers, left all thoſe vnder his conduct in their ordinary ſtations, &amp;c.

               <p>Obſeru. Here is another Accuſation, with a blank left for any, whom you ſhall here after deſign to ruin: whom in due time you will call to mind.</p>
               <p>Narrat. <hi>All theſe had their Commiſsions or Patents, ſtamped by the General of the Ieſuits</hi> Ioannes Paulus d'Oliua.</p>
               <p>Obſeru. How comes it, that you hauing had the diſtribution of theſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions,</hi> (as you ſayd before the Parliament, &amp; in ſeuerall tryals, &amp; in this <hi>Narratiue</hi> p. 59.) ſhould not haue kept one at leaſt of them, to Conuince the world, there is ſomething tru?

If your Memory failed you in a matter ſo often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, what credit doth it deſerue in things, which occurred but once? And if you are foreſworne in this, who will beleiue you in the reſt?</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider the probability of this ſtory, from the qualitys of the Perſons who are ſayd to haue giuen, and receiued theſe <hi>Commiſsions.</hi> You ſay, a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Religious men by his <hi>Patents</hi> makes a <hi>Chancelour,</hi> the <hi>Secretarys of ſtate,</hi> the <hi>General</hi> &amp; <hi>ſubordinate Officers</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> in fine diſpoſes as Soueraign, of all <hi>Offices, Ciuil,</hi> &amp; <hi>Military</hi> of the whole <hi>Kingdome.</hi> An attempt not to be paralleled, but by that of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to be <hi>like God.</hi> All the world knows, that the Authority of <hi>Religious Superiours,</hi> as ſuch, euen in Catholick Countrys, is confiued within the Walls of their Order, &amp; reaches no perſons, but ſuch as by their own Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Act ſubmit themſelues to it: That the General of the Ieſuits hath no power ouer his own Religious longer then they continu ſuch: for if any of them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152770:34"/>be rayſed by a ſuperior Power to an Eccleſiaſticall Dignity, or diſmiſt for their miſde meanours, his Autority reaches them not. This being known to all, who know any thing of the Catholick world, who can imagin ſuch a <hi>Superiour</hi> ſhould on a ſuddain take vpon him <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> &amp; diſpoſe of all <hi>Temporall Dignitys,</hi> &amp; <hi>Offices,</hi> which is an Act of <hi>ſupreame Iuriſdiction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Perſons receiuing <hi>Commiſsions,</hi> they are the Engliſh Catholick Nobility, &amp; Gentry. And althô many of them neuer dealt with Jeſuits, euen in ſpirituall things, had little kindneſſe for them, further then they are obliged by being parts of the ſame myſticall Body, the Church: yet, as you ſay, all vnanimouſly ſubmit to the vſurpation of that Religious man. They all knew, that their Anceſtors, of the ſame Principles of Religion to God, &amp; Allegiance to their Prince, had conſtantly refuſed to own any Temporall Authority in the Pope, although grounded, as was alleadged, on the King's free gift. Yet now this ſame body of men is ſayd to own a much greater Authority in one of the Pope's Vnder-Officers. This ſtrang Tranſaction is made, &amp; nothing of, or about it appeares, but in your <hi>Narratiue!</hi> Not one of them refuſe to ſubmit or at leaſt demur! not one diſdain to become ſubiect to a Poor Religious Man! Not one acknowledge the fault, althô they were aſſured of their Pardon, &amp; a good reward to boot! That euen thoſe, who to free themſelues from vexatious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, changed their Religion, ſhould be conſtant in denying the Plot &amp; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions And which is more this thing ſo ridiculous, ſo incredible, ſo morally, or euen Phyſically impoſſible, is to be beleiued vpon the ſingle word, &amp; Oath of a man Faithleſſe to God, &amp; Honourleſſe to men: one who ſcarce euer ſpoke a tru Word, &amp; who deſerues no credit euen when he ſpeakes probable things. The Deuil was a <hi>Lyer from the beginning:</hi> &amp; you, from your cradle. A Wiſe man hauing weyghed theſe motiues ſeriouſly, althô he knew nothing of the particular Facts, concluded, that <hi>ether what</hi> Homer, <hi>&amp;</hi> Ouid writ <hi>of their Gods,</hi> Aeſop <hi>of Beaſts, were no Fables, or the English Conſpiracy is a Fable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet O Iuſt Iudment of Almighty God! <hi>The finger of God is heere.</hi> It hath found credit. Indeed our Nation or a great part of it, hauing rejected many Diuine &amp; ſauing Truths reuealed by the H. Ghoſt the ſpirit of Truth, preacht by the Apoſtles the Doctors of Truth, &amp; handed down to vs by the Church the Pillar of Truth, deſerues ſuch blindneſs, as to beleiue improbale Lyes, ſuggeſted by the Deuil, the Father of Lyes, &amp; deſiuered by you, who are a faithfull Diſciple of that Faithleſſe maſter: to whoſe inſtructions of Lying, you haue always adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in whoſe ſchool you are ſuch a Proficient, that no hyſtory to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance furniſhs your equall.

               <p>I Haue followed you through all your wandrings, with greater tediouſneſſe, then may be imagined, finding no entertainment all the way, but euident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, infamous perjurys, &amp; ſometimes ſome inſipid leſts. It hath been ſome labour to examin all the particular Facts you mention, when Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned are at ſo great a diſtance. Yet I haue gone thorough all willingly for the publick ſatisfaction, &amp; for a cleer conuiction of ſuch, as though there was ſome fire where there was ſo much ſmoke, if ſtill there are any ſuch in the world. I hope it may be for your own good too, who by this diſcouery of ſo many ſhamefull Periuries, being diſabled to follow the trade of a Witneſſe, may be obliged to take to ſome more honeſt though leſſe gainfull way of liuing. This may be a meanes to ſaue your ſoul, for there <hi>is a Confuſion, which brings Grace &amp; Glory.</hi> Eccleſiaſtici 4.25. &amp; the Pſalmiſt Pſ. 82.16. <hi>Fill their Face with shame, &amp; they will ſeek thee, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>J haue aduanced nothing materiall, but what is certainly tru. The cheifeſt points are atteſted by Witneſſes of vnblemiſht Reputation. I now appeal to one who is vncorruptible, your own Conſcience, which within you confirmes all, I ſay, &amp; ſets before the eyes of your ſoul, your guilt, more liuely then any one can doe. Jt is that, which before you took on you publickely, without any cauſe giuen by any Catholick, the Perſon of an Informer, when the firſt <hi>Idea</hi> of the many Lyes, &amp; horrible Perjurys occurred to you, forced you with ſignes of great anguiſh of mind to ſay: <hi>No body knows what</hi> DISMAL THOUGHTS, <hi>I haue had in that Chamber,</hi> ſhewing that where you then lodged. It was that, which at the tryall of the fiue Ieſuits made you ready to <hi>Faint:</hi> &amp; howeuer with vnparalelled confidence you accuſe vs before men: Yet before God, &amp; in your own hart, that abſolues vs, &amp; finds you Guilty. Or if it doth not, if it ceaſes from that function, or if you are ſo hardned, as to be inſenſible of its remorſe, your condition is the more deplorable, there being little or no hopes left of your ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Should I ſay, that ſome of your Accuſations are of words ſpoken by your ſelfe, &amp; charged on others, who often reprehended you, &amp; at laſt quite aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned you for them, I ſhould ſay no more, then your familiar diſcourſe euen ſince this fit of Zeal for the ſafety of his Majeſty's Sacred Perſon came vpon you, will iuſtify, as I am informed. My Lord cheife Iuſtice told you (in ſir
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152770:36"/>G. W. s. ttiall. p. 56.) <hi>You haue taken a great confidence, I know not by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to ſay any thing of any body.</hi> This is a tru ſaying: &amp; how long that <hi>Confidence</hi> ſo Publickly known will paſſe vnpuniſht, I cannot tell. J am ſure the Wiſe man ſayd: <hi>Qui inconſideratus eſt ad loquendum, ſentiet mala.</hi> Prou. 13. 3 <hi>He that is inconſiderate in his language, shall feel miſcheife.</hi> Here is one great Miſcheife, iuſtly to be feared, hanging ouer your head.</p>
               <p>Another, &amp; that much more terrible, is that of eternall Damnation iuſtly due to Falſe Witneſſes, &amp; Murtherers. Now that you are a Falſe witneſſe, appeares by the foregoing diſcourſe; &amp; that you are a Murtherer, is euident, hauing murthred as many Perſons, as haue innocently ſuffred, vpon your Depoſitions. Thus S. Auſtin in Pſal. 63. <hi>Ille occidit, &amp; vos, ô Iudaei occidiſtis. Vnde occidiſtis; Gladio linguae.</hi> Our Sauiour's blood was iuſtly charged on the Jews, who killed him, with their falſe Accuſations: &amp; as iuſtly are you charged with the murther of all thoſe, who haue as vniuſtly been accuſed by you, &amp; condemned, &amp; executed vpon your Accuſation.</p>

No.</hi> about 3. or 4. a clock after Dinnar, and continued in that Office till the 21. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1678. without being abſent (if at al) aboue one half day from the Gate al that time, do declare in the preſence of God Almighty, that the ſaid <hi>Titus Oates</hi> neuer went out of the Colledge but onely once to <hi>Watten,</hi> where he ſtayed onely one night or two at moſt; of which I am moſt certain, becauſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon going about the houſe to cal people to the Gate, I frequently met him. Moreouer during his aboad at <hi>S. Omers</hi> he ſate alone at a table almoſt oppoſite to that where I ſate, and this euery day, except ſome 5. or 6 on which he was ſick in the Infirmary, and the two days he was at <hi>Watten,</hi> and I think alſo ſome few days whilſt he was in the ſpiritual exerciſes that he came to the ſecond Table Al which I declare to be true, vpon my hopes of ſalvation. So the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the 10. and 29. Articles are meer lyes.</p>
               <p>I do in a like manner declare in the preſence of Almighty God that neither <hi>Sr. Robert Bret Bart</hi> nor <hi>F. Antony Pool,</hi> nor <hi>F. Edward Neuil</hi> went from the ſaid
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152770:47"/>Colledge to <hi>England</hi> vpon Score of the Congregation or <hi>Conſult,</hi> as he cals it: which I know becauſe I converſt with them al thoſe two months <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> as before and after: wherefore I am certain theſe three, as wel as <hi>T. Oates</hi> were at <hi>S. Omers</hi> al the time of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>And I do in a like manner and vpon the ſame Proteſtation of my hopes of ſaluation declare that neither the Rector of <hi>Liege</hi> whom <hi>T. Oates</hi> cals <hi>F. Warren,</hi> Nor <hi>Sr. Thomas Preſton</hi> euer were in the whole months of <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May</hi> 1678. at the ſaid Colledge of <hi>S. Omers</hi> vnleſſe they were inviſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item</hi> whereas <hi>T. Oates</hi> from <hi>Art.</hi> 11. to <hi>Art.</hi> 32. of his <hi>Narratiue</hi> ſwears he ſaw, read, or heard read ſeueral letters of dangerous conſequence, as if he had at that time great commerce, familiarity, and intimacy with <hi>F. Richard Ashby</hi> then Rector. I declare that by reaſon of my Office of Porter I had dayly ſeueral occaſions to go to the ſaid <hi>Rector</hi> to carry him all the letters that came, and Acquaint him with al Comers and Goers and ſuch things as happened about the Gate, and that generally ſpeaking hee opened the letters which I brought in my preſence, and ſent mee to cal thoſe whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but I ſwear hee never called <hi>T. Oates</hi> at leaſt by mee: and that I never found or ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> with him in al the frequent viſits, which my Office obliged mee to make to the ſaid <hi>Rector;</hi> Nay I was ſo far from perceaueing any familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity betwixt them, that quite contrary I often heard great complaints againſt the ſaid <hi>T. Oates</hi> as that hee was vnfit for that houſe; that his company was dangerous among the young ſchollers, and that the Provincial ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to Order his ſpeedy removeal thence: ſome ſaid hee had no more Religion then a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g: ſome told him this openly, and ſaid, that hee was either a knave or a Fool. Beſides ſometimes hee was heard to hold dangerous diſcourſes of Perſons much better then himſelfe, for which hee was once beaten by a ſcholler, and often ſeverely reprehended by ſome Superiors. Item that when hee fel out with ſome of the Schollers (which by reaſon of his foul mouth and offenſiue language hapned very often) hee applyed himſelf to mee to procure him audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>R. F. Rector.</hi> Al which conſidered I leaue to any rational man to iudg whether it bee probable that hee had ſuch free acceſſe and general communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of letters and buſineſſes, as hee pretends with the Rector. Jn witneſſe of the truth of al theſe things here declared vpon my Oath and in the preſence of Almighty God, I ſet my hand.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX <hi>Bedlow's</hi> trauels, and Plots.</head>
            <p>WIth the leaue of the pretended <hi>Doctor,</hi> I will giue a ſhort, yet tru Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Confederate <hi>Bedlow's</hi> journy through <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain,</hi> to ailay his Lying Ghoſt, which walkes about in a falſe Depoſition giuen vp during his laſt ſickneſſe, as is reported.</p>
            <p>He &amp; his Brother acted by turns the Maſter &amp; the man: &amp; both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to impoſe on thoſe, whom they cheated: ſo I ſhall ſpeak of both.</p>
            <p>Jn the ſummer 1677. he came to Gant; taking the name of My Lord <hi>Newport:</hi> &amp; thence to the <hi>Holland Camp,</hi> at, or neer <hi>Bruges</hi> &amp; cheated Capt. <hi>Floyde</hi> of an Engliſh horſe. He went thence by <hi>Doway</hi> (where he ſpoke with Dr. <hi>Gage</hi> Preſident of the Engliſh Colledge) to <hi>Cambray,</hi> taking the name of My Lord <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> &amp; borrowed of Mr. <hi>Lionel Sheldon,</hi> twelue Pieces. Thence he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where with the ſame name he borrowed (as was ſayd) 100. piſtols of Dr. <hi>Gough</hi> bought very rich Linnen, &amp; beſpoke a ſute worth 80. piſtols of <hi>Groin</hi> an Iriſh man, dwelling <hi>rue de Seine aux trois Poiſſons Faubourg S. Germain.</hi> Thence he paſt to <hi>Rouën,</hi> &amp; borrowed twelue piſtols of Mr. <hi>Price</hi> Confeſſor to the Engliſh <hi>Nuns</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Thence he paſt into <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; at <hi>Bilbao</hi> taking the name of the Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> found credit with Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi> for 300. <hi>Doblons.</hi> He paſt thence to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where on the 29. <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he viſited F. <hi>Hierome Lincol,</hi> Rector of the Iriſh Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, told him he was going to <hi>Porto Porto</hi> to meet his train, &amp; equipage: with which he expected a <hi>Blew Horſe,</hi> which my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had giuen him, &amp; he would preſent to the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> That he had ſome doubts about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which none but his Holineſſe ſhould anſwer. He hired thence Mules for <hi>Porto Porto,</hi> &amp; was aduanced on his way thither as far as <hi>Lamorra:</hi> where he was ouertaken by a <hi>Sergeant</hi> of the Chancery of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> at the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Franklin,</hi> who hauing heard he was a <hi>Cheate,</hi> purſued him, to recouer his mony.</p>
            <p>The two Brothers were thence conueyghed Priſoners to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> but being ſet free, they viſited Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in the Engliſh Colledge there: who left them in Chamber, whilſt he went to get them a dinner, &amp; they the meane while were not idle, for finding ten pieces of eyght in a Drawer, they tooke them away as appeares by a letter written by <hi>Oates</hi> to F. <hi>Suiman:</hi> which is to be ſeen at <hi>S. Omers:</hi> in which he laments the loſſe of his mony, &amp; much more that of a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152770:48"/>Book, which they ſtole from him at the ſame time. Thence they went by <hi>Santiago</hi> to <hi>Corunna (la Groin)</hi> where they imbarked for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I grant that Capt. <hi>Bedlow</hi> went <hi>Plotting</hi> thorough <hi>Flanders, France, Spain,</hi> for this whole Relation diſcouers it: but his Plotting was not againſt his Sacred Majeſty's Perſon, or Gouernment but againſt the purſes of honeſt men, whom he &amp; his Brother endeauoured to cheate. In the Original Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his trauels <hi>in Spain,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Oates's</hi> Letter, ſeueral more pranks of his are ſpecifyed, which will be made publicke by another pen. Hence it appeares, that, if he did at his Death depoſe the things, which are publiſht, he dyed as he liued, <hi>Cheating,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lying. Qualis Vita, finis ita.</hi> God Bleſſe all Chriſtians from ſuch a life, &amp; ſuch a Death.</p>
